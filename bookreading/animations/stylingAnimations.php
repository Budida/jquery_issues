        <p>Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth
        on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty,
        and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created
        equal.
        </p>
        <p>Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether
        that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated,
        can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of
        that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that
        field as a final resting-place for those who here gave
        their lives that the nation might live. It is altogether
        fitting and proper that we should do this. But, in a
        larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate,
        we cannot hallow, this ground.
