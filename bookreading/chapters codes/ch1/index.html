      <p>There was a book lying near Alice on the table, and while she sat watching the White King (for she was still a little anxious about him, and had the ink all ready to throw over him, in case he fainted again), she turned over the leaves, to find some part that she could read, <span class="spoken">"&mdash;for it's all in some language I don't know,"</span> she said to herself.</p>
      <p>It was like this.</p>
      <div class="poem">
        <h3 class="poem-title">YKCOWREBBAJ</h3>
        <div class="poem-stanza">
          <div>sevot yhtils eht dna ,gillirb sawT'</div>
          <div>;ebaw eht ni elbmig dna eryg diD</div>

        </div>
      </div>
      <p>She puzzled over this for some time, but at last a bright thought struck her. <span class="spoken">"Why, it's a Looking-glass book, of course! And if I hold it up to a glass, the words will all go the right way again."</span></p>
      <p>This was the poem that Alice read.</p>
